## HR Salary Prediction Dashboard- Train the Dataset and Predict Salary
The main objective of this project is to build a salary prediction dashboard for HRs. We are expected to create a dashboard that predicts the salary of HRs when they switch their jobs.
We are given a dataset containing the information about the salary details of people. We want to predict their salary.

The proposed model applies data transformation and machine learning on the available features in the dataset. Our final aim is to predict salary for a job posting based on these available features and build a salary prediction dashboard for HRs.
